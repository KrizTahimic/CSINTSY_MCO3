üìù**About**:
   - A Travel Adviser Agent (TAA) that can advise Filipino travelers from the Philippines as they plan to travel to Denmark 
     amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
   - Most predicates were made in the form of questions; after they are asked, they will be asserted as either true or false.
   - TAA uses Prolog and backward chaining to answer and provide guidance to the traveler and their
     party (in case they're not traveling alone). The maximum number of members of any travel party
     is four, including the traveler using TAA.
   - A traveler consults the Trip Adviser Agent. During this consultation, TAA asks questions about their
     profile, their travel party (if not traveling alone), and then a recommendation: if they're (or their party) allowed
     to travel, and if yes, what documents have to be prepared, including procedures to follow upon arrival in
     the country such as the quarantine period and other requirements. As part of the scope, only: (i) returning
     residents travel as a family, and (ii) tourists also travel as a family.
   - This version considers that there are many different kinds of travelers: citizen (for dual citizens), returning
     resident (a Filipino who holds a resident visa in another country, but not a citizen of that country), overseas
     Filipino worker, official business (traveling as function of one‚Äôs job), or as a tourist.
